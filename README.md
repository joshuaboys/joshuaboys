# **Hey my name is Josh!**

### I am the CEO and Founder of Arkahna and a published DMs Guild Author. I am passionate about giving opportunities to the next generation of developer and empowering people from marginalised groups.
### I love building high performing teams in sustainable ways and finding new ways to do things. Just because it has always been done that way, doesn't mean there isn't a better way.
